Soldered Breadboard Assembly Instructions
=====================

(please note that these steps represent what I beilive to be the optimal order of operations. They may not be. Addionaly not all boards were assembled in this way as I expermented with the order)

1) Cut perfreated breadboard to the correct size
2) Solder Headers onto the breadboard
3) Solder wires that run on the top of the board. Start with VCC and GND conections as these are the longest
4) Creat nessary solder briges on the bottom
5) Solder in wires on the bottom
6) Insure that all nessary points are connected
7) Add extra support headers for the uSD, accel, and gyro
8) Solder I2C wires to the arduino
9) Place batt into RTC
10) Solder arduino, uSD holder, and RTC onto the board
11) Solder I2C wire into bread board
12) Solder on accel and gyro
