# Sharkduino V2

This board was designed by William Laney as part of the College of William and Mary's physics undergraduate research, 2016. 
Questions or concerns can be directed to William Laney at welaney@email.wm.edu

This is a sensor board desgined to be used with marine science research. This board consits of the following sensors and ports:

* MMA8452QT 3-axis acceloramter
* FXAS21002 3-axis gyroscope
* DS1339B real time clock (RTC)
* MCP73831 LiPo charger
* Molex 8+2 pin microSD card slot
* Female micro USB slot
* Male JPL 2 pronge connector

The device takes data from the sensors and writes it to a microSD card with a time stamp for the RTC. It is powered by a LiPo battery that is connected to the JPL connector. This battery can be reachared using the micro USB slot which is conected to the MCP73831 LiPo charger. In addition to recodeing data hardware interups are connected from the RTC and accelrometer to the Arduino.

This board is designed to have a 3.3V, 8Mhz Arduino Pro Mini stack ontop of the board.

## Designe Information

Printed on the board's silk screen are labeled arrows corresponding to the positive direction of movment for the accerometer. The postive direction for rotation of the gyrscope is allined with these arrows, and reprsentins rotation around these axis.

The MMA8452QT is a 3-axis digital accelrometer. The chip uses I2C communication protical. The I2C address for the MMA84520 is 0x1C in hex (00011100 in binary). The interupt 1 pin on the accelrometer is broken out to pin 3 on the Arduino.

The FXAS21002 is 3-axis digital gyroscope. The chip can use the I2C or SPI communcication proticals, however only I2C has been broken out, SPI has been disabled. The I2C address for this chips is 0x20 in hex (100000 in binary).

The DS1339B is a real time clock (RTC) with battery backup. This chip uses the I2C communication protical. The address for this chip is 0xd0 in hex (11010000 in binary). The oscilator used in this desgine with the RTC is the Abracon LLC ABS25-32.768KHZ-T. It is a 32.768kHz quartz cystal oscillator, with a load capactance of 12.5pF. A 12mm coin cell holder is used for the battery back up in this desgine. It is recomend to use a 3v 1225 coin cell battery. The squarwave/interupt pin on the RTC is broekn out to. 

Data connections were not run underneath the DS1339B IC or the ABS25 as to not interfere with the oscillatator. Two of the feet on the ABS25 exist for structal reasons. They are floating grounds and should not be attached to the true ground or any conections.

The Molex microSD slot is connected through the arduino hardware SPI pins (11, 12, and 13) with pin 10 being used for chip select.

The MCP7381 IC is not connected to any pins on the arduino. It connects the uUSB slot and the JPL 2 prong connector. Additonaly it is connected to a red SMD LED that indicates when the LiPo battery is charing. 

The male JPL 2 prong connector is connected to the RAW pin. Additinaly two header pins are connected to RAW and ground. This was done to allow for addional power and charging options, however these headers are on the wrong side of the LiPo charger regulator to saflty be used to charge the battery. This will be corected in the next version of the device.

The large white dot on the silkscreen in the area for the chip corresponds to a dot on the same location on the physical chip package, and assures that the chip is attached to the board with the proper orientation.

Both the bottom and top layers of this board contain ground pours to insure proper grounding and to mimize noise and interfence between signal traces.

All traces on this board between the sensors and the arduino are 0.01" and the vias have 0.02" drill holes. This is more than sufficient to handle the current through the traces. Right angles in the trace are avoid to help ensure data integrity. The traces used in part of the LiPo charging circuity, and the conection between the JPL conector and the Arduino RAW pin are 0.012" and the vias have 0.02" drill holes. This additonal size is to accomidate the larger amounts of current that could travel through these traces, however this size increase should be unnesary and was done in part becaue there was avalibale space on the board to do it.

The board is aranged in a trapazodal shape in order to more closly mirror the fin shape of a sandbar shark.

The board is desgined to have an Arduino Pro Mini sit ontop of it and have the pins holes on the arduino aline wiht the pin wholes on the board. However not every whole on the arduino has a corsponding pin on the board, this was done to allow gaps for traces to run through. The only pins on the arduino that are activly used by this device are RAW, GND, VCC, 2, 3, 10, 11, 12, 13, A4, and A5. All other pins on the arduino are floating.

Decoupling capacitors were added as near to the chips as possible to minimize noise to the chips. This is detailed in the relevant data sheets.

No vias were placed under the uSD reader to prevent accidental ground connections when the uSD card is inserted.

0805 package size is used for all passive components. This size was selected because I believe it to be a good compromise between size and ease of placement. The LED indicator light uses an 0603 package size.

On November 18, 2016 six boards were ordered from OSHpark for \$25.50. This corresponds to \$4.25 per board. Additonaly on November 18, 2016 a 3mil polyimide film solder stencil for the top layer of the board was ordered from OSH Stencils for \$10.11.
