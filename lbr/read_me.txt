The abracon lbr comes form the following source:
https://github.com/cmonr/Eagle-Libraries/blob/master/Other/abracon.lbr
I have checked it for the abs25 and it looks good. I increased the size of the silk scrren wire width, and added a tdoc layer. The silk sreen crosses the pads, instead of fixing it I'll let the fab house just not print it

the sharkduino lbr is created in full by me
