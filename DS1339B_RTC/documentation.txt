DS1339B Breakout
======================
This board was designed by William Laney as part of the College of William and Mary's physics undergraduate research, 2016.

This is a breakout board for the DS1339B IC. The DS1339B is a real time clock (RTC) with battery backup. This chip uses the I2C communication protical. The address for this chip is 0xd0 in hex (11010000 in binary). Addtionaly this chip has a brokenout square wave/interupt pin.

The board is designed to be stackable with the Sparkfun MMA8452 breakout board. To allow for this functionality, one unused header pin holes have been added between the SQW/INT pin and ground pins.

This breakout board is functional with all DS1339 chips. However the oscilator outlined in the BOM has a equivalnet series restance then is recomend for the non DS1339B chips in the family.

The oscilator used in this desgine is the Abracon LLC ABS25-32.768KHZ-T. It is a 32.768kHz quartz cystal oscillator, with a load capactance of 12.5pF. This oscilator was chossen for its small foot print and price.

Two of the feet on the ABS25 exist for structal reasons. They are floating grounds and should not be attached to the true ground or any conections.

A 12mm coin cell holder is used for the battery back up in this desgine. It is recomend to use a 3v 1225 coin cell battery.

Please note that the exposed pad under the coin cell holder must be covered with solder inorder for the battery to form a connection.

The traces related to the DS3234 are 0.01" and the vias have 0.02" drill holes. This is more than sufficient to handle the current through the traces. Right angles in the trace are avoided to help ensure data integrity.

Data connections were not run underneath the DS1339B IC or the ABS25 as to not interfere with the oscillatator. A power line trace from the battery backup crosses under the corner of the ABS25. This is unfortunate, but it was decied that since this trace was a power line, not a signal line, more damage would be done to the oscilator sginal by moving the ABS farther from the DS1339B, then the interfence from the trace.

The bottom and top layers of the board contain ground pours. These pours are conneted through the GND pin and a via. These pours both insure good grounding in the board and isolate the oscilator from noise.

Decoupling capacitors were added as near to the chips as possible to minimize noise to the chips. This is detailed in the relevant data sheets.

0805 package size is used for all passive components. This size was selected because I believe it to be a good compromise between size and ease of placement. 

On September 23 2016 3 v1 boards were ordered from OSHpark for $2.75. This corresponds to $0.92 per board.
