Sharkduinov1 Layer 2
======================
This board was designed by William Laney as part of the College of William and Mary's physics REU program, 2016. 
Questions or concerns can be directed to William Laney at welaney@email.wm.edu

This is a breakout board for the DS3234 IC and the MCP7381 IC. The DS3234 is a real time clock (RTC) with battery backup. The MCP7381 is a power regulator for LiPo battery charging from USB. This board can be viewed as a shield for an 3.3V Arduino Pro Mini as it can stack on top of the pro mini.

In addition to the ICs listed above, this board contains a female micro USB (uUSB) port, a 12mm coin cell slot, and a male JPL 2 prong connector. The male JPL 2 prong connector connects the LiPo battery to the board. The 12mm coin cell slot holds a CR1225 coin cell battery that acts as the battery backup for the DS3234. The female uUSB port is for charging the LiPo battery.


Desgine Inofrmation
--------------------
The DS3234 is connected through SPI. The chip select pin is 9. The square wave pin is 2. The coin cell slot is not connected to a pin, but is connected directly to the DS3234.

The male JPL 2 prong connector is connected to the RAW pin.

The MCP7381 IC is not connected to any pins. It connects the uUSB slot and the JPL 2 prong connector.

All traces relating to the LiPo battery and uUSB slot are 0.016". This is larger than the traces used on the layer 1 board and the DS3234. This increased trace size accommodates the larger currents that need to flow through these connections, and provides additional overhead in case of probes with the battery or the charging.

The traces related to the DS3234 are 0.01" and the vias have 0.02" drill holes. This is more than sufficient to handle the current through the traces. Right angles in the trace are avoided to help ensure data integrity.

The bottom and top layers of this board contain ground pours. The top ground pour is connected to the left hand Arduino Pro Mini ground, and the bottom pour is attached to right. These directions are from a top view of the board. The pours are connected in various areas through vias. This is especially important because the bottom ground pour is separated into two sides for the majority of the board due to the RAW trace.

Most pins holes on the board are not connected, and are there to provide stacking functionality with the Arduino Pro Mini. The only holes that are in use are the ones labeled on the silk screen (that is, pins in use on either this board or the layer one board). 

Data connections were not run underneath the DS3234 IC on the top layer so as to not interfere with the oscillator. Additionally, a top layer ground pour prevents the bottom layer data connections from interfering.

A red LED is attached to the MCP7381 to act as a charging indicator light. While the light is, on the battery is charging.

Decoupling capacitors were added as near to the chips as possible to minimize noise to the chips. This is detailed in the relevant data sheets.

The printed arrows on the silk screen correspond directly to the orientation of the accelerometer. Please note that the accelerometer, or any directional sensor, are not on this board. Due to the stacking nature of the design, it is important that the orientation information be easily readable on every level.

The white dot on the silk screen corresponds to a dot on the same location on the physical DS3234 chip and assures that the chip is attached to the board in the proper orientation. Outlines of the components serve this purpose for the coin cell slot, uUSB slot and the JPL connector.

0805 package size is used for all passive components. This size was selected because I believe it to be a good compromise between size and ease of placement. However, due to size constraints, the LED and the 22pF capacitor are smaller packages. (0603 and 0402 respectively).

On July 7 2016, six v1 boards were ordered from OSHpark for $14.10. This corresponds to $2.35 per board.


Assembily Information
-------------------------
Assemblie steps:
(please note that these steps represent what I beilive to be the optimal order of operations. They may not be. Addionaly not all boards were assembled in this way as I expermented with the order)
1) Applie solder paste for DS3234
2) Place DS3234
3) Applie solder paste for 0402 size 22pF capcitor
4) Place 0402 size 22pF capcitor
5) Applie solder paste for MCP7381 IC, 0805 4.7uF capcitor adjacent to MCP7381, and LED. The postive side of the LED should face away from the MCP7381 IC
6) Place MCP7381 IC, 0805 4.7uF capcitor adjacent to MCP7381, and LED
7) Applie solder paste for all remaing passive components
8) Place all remaing passive components
9) Applie solder paste for 12mm coin cell slot
10) Place 12mm coin cell slot
11) Applie solder past for uUSB female connector
12) Place uUSB female connector
13) Place full board into solder reflow oven
14) Wipe down with isopropal alchohal
15) Applie hot glue around uUSB female connector
16) Solder on JPL 2 prong connectro with soldering iron
17) check if the board is shorted between GND and VCC
18) check if the board is shorted between GND and RAW

Be sure the DS3234 chip is in the correct orentation. The notch on the chip corroponds to the white dot on the board.

Be sure to use a good amount of solder paste for the 0402 22pF capacitor so it stays in place during relfow. It has flipped up to be perpendicular to the board in relfow

Be sure the LED is placed in the correct orientation, it is a polarized component.

Solder paste must be put on the pad under the 12mm coin cell slot. While no component is attached to this pad, the solder is needed to ensure a good connection between the battery and the board.

When appling the uUSB connector be carful, it is very easy so slide out of alginment. Addionaly do not try to use it until it is hot glued into place. The solder does not firmly attach the connector to the board.


Feature Requests/ Improvents
----------------------------
add I2C pins for breakout to layer3 board
put cut out for coin cell battery removal
spell sharkduino corrctly on bottom layer silk screen
add turn on switch
square/ aline components
remove pin hole next to batt (pin 4)
rexeaine charging circuity to insure that the LED indicator light is correct


V1.1 Changes
=================
Spelled sharkduino correctly
Removed pin 4
moved batt up board
The LED chargin circuit appears to be correct. The LED was installed backward


V1.1 notes
--------------
I2C pins do not fit b/c of clock chip
Will not put battery cut out to minimze corners
